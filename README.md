<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is about showing inderstry standards when developing front end and back end content.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, this is my attempt and its a personal project thats being marked. It is a fully functioning website that connects to a local database but please use at your own disclosure.
